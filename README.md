# ArduinoCalculatorSnakeAn 
easy-to-make fun project and somewhat helpful! 
It's a device that can do math but also can play the 'ol classic snake game. 
The main part of the project is the central microcontroller the ATMEGA328p. 
I used it because its one of the most popular low-cost microcontrollers and easy to use! 
For the screen, I went with the classic Nokia 5110 because it gives the cool retro pixel experience that many old phones had. 
For the keypad its just a bunch of tact push-buttons aranged in a matrix configuration.
 Powering this thing is pretty easy with just a small Li-Po battery of around 400mah should last for a while
